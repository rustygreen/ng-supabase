<!-- <p align="center">
An Angular 17+ library for <a href="https://supabase.com/" target="_blank">Supabase</a> projects. The purpose of this library is to simplify and speed up development for Angular projects that use Supabase. This project consists of components specifically designed

powered AOT compatible device detector that helps to identify browser, os and other useful information regarding the device using the app. The processing is based on user-agent. This library was built at <a href="https://github.com/KoderLabs">KoderLabs</a>, which is one of the best places I've worked at ❤️

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve demo`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Commands

Create new UI library
```bash
npx nx generate @nx/angular:library --name=UI_LIB_NAME --buildable=true --directory=libs/bootstrap --publishable=true --changeDetection=OnPush --importPath=@ng-supabase/UI_LIB_NAME --prefix=supabase --projectNameAndRootFormat=as-provided --style=scss --no-interactive
``` -->

## Development

### Create New Release

To generate a new release, use the following steps:

1. Run `npm run nx -- release --skip-publish` locally. This will create a commit with the version and changelog updates
2. Commit changes `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: bumped version"`.
3. Create a tag for the new version `git tag <tagname>`.
4. Push the changes (including the new tag) to the remote repository with `git push && git push --tags`.
5. The publish workflow will automatically trigger and publish the packages to the npm registry.

_see more on these steps [here](https://nx.dev/recipes/nx-release/publish-in-ci-cd)_
